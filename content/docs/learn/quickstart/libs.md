# Overview of libraries

Arrow is not a single library, but a collection of them. The guiding principle is that each Arrow library should be _self-contained_: each library improves or extends a single commonly-used library in the Kotlin ecosystem (like `arrow-core` and `arrow-fx-coroutines`) or a particular Kotlin language feature (like `arrow-optics`), or focuses on a particular set of tasks (like `arrow-resilience`).

Note that during the transition to Arrow 2.x some libraries were further split. If you are an Arrow 1.x user you can follow the deprecation warnings to make the switch to the new organization, or read our [2.0 / 1.2.0 migration guide](../../quickstart/migration/).

| Library | Features |

# Introduction

Most, if not all, of the systems we develop nowadays require the cooperation of
other services, which may live in the same process, in the same machine, or may
require some network communication. This creates a lot of different potential
scenarios where things may fail. **Resilience** is the ability of your system 
to act in an organized way when those events occur.

Your particular approach to resilience depends on multiple factors. Is it
possible to try that request again? Should the administrator be alerted if the
detected error is fatal? Instead of predefined answers, Arrow aims to provide
a set of **tools** that you can compose to specify your solution in a concise
and composable way.

:::caution Arrow pre-1.2.0

In Arrow series 1.0.x and 1.1.x, these types were provided as part of the
`arrow-fx-coroutines` library. From 1.2.0 on they live in `arrow-resilience`,
even though a migration window is in place until Arrow 2.0.

:::

The Arrow Fx Resilience library implements three of the most critical design
pattern around resilience:

- Retry and repeat computations using [`Schedule`](../retry-and-repeat),
- Protect other services from being overloaded using [`CircuitBreaker`](../circuitbreaker),
- Implement transactional behavior in distributed systems in the form of [`Saga`](../saga).

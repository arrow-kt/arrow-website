# Nicer Data Transformation With KopyKat and Optics

Watch [Alejandro Serrano](https://twitter.com/trupill)'s presentation from KotlinConf 2023 about data transformation.

Data classes are incredibly useful when modeling our domain in an immutable way. The Kotlin compiler gives us many niceties, including 'copy' to create a new value based on a previous one. However, this 'copy' often falls short. This talk explores two alternatives: KopyKat, a plug-in to generate additional variations of 'copy', and Arrow Optics, a whole framework to transform this immutable data.

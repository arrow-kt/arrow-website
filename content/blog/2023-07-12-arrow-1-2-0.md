# Arrow releases stable 1.2.0 version

We're excited to announce the stable Arrow 1.2.0 version. To briefly summarize, this release:

- Improves the API for [typed errors](http://arrow-kt.io/learn/typed-errors/working-with-typed-errors/),
  including [`withError`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core.raise/with-error.html)
  and [`merge`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core.raise/merge.html).
- Adds [`NonEmptyCollection`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core/-non-empty-collection/index.html)
  as common parent of [`NonEmptyList`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core/-non-empty-list/index.html)
  and [`NonEmptySet`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core/-non-empty-set/index.html).
- Introduces [`arrow-core-serialization`](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/quickstart/serialization/)
  to be used alongside KotlinX Serialization.
- Fixes a few issues found in the Release Candidate.

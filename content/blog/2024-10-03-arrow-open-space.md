# Arrow Open Space @ [Lambda World](https://lambda.world)

The first [Arrow & Fuctional Kotlin Open Space](https://www.lambda.world/workshops/Arrow%20%26%20Functional%20Kotlin%20Open%20Space/) is taking place as part of [Lambda World](https://lambda.world)! This post contains the preliminary schedule, and shall be updated after the Open Space takes place with additional material, slides, and videos.

## Unconference

We have a nice room, some sweets, and a nice projector. The perfect setup to share some knowledge about Arrow and Functional Kotlin! Our goal with the Unconference is to bring together people who can talk about something and people who want to learn about something.

_How does it work?_ Please talk to one of the people in charge so they can change the spreadsheet.

- If you want to learn about a topic...
  - If the topic is not yet in the spreadsheet, add it in the first column with the _Requested_ status.
  - If the topic is in the spreadsheet, contact the potential speaker.
- If you want to talk about a topic...
  - If it is already in the spreadsheet, shout it out loud and let the talk begin!
  - If not, add your topic and name with the _Waiting_ status, and wait for somebody to request it.
- Once the talk begins, change it status to _In progress_, and once it is finished, move it to _Done_.
  - It would be great if any material or code would be shared with the organizers, so we can later add it to this page.

## Build together

The goal of the Open Space is to learn. Many of us around are happy to help, so feel free to work in any project you want, and explore ways to use more functional features in your Kotlin. Once again, don't be shy to ask :)

If you are not sure about where to start, we have prepared a few tutorials and projects for you.

- [Pok√©-Fun with Kotlin and Arrow](https://serranofp.com/poke-fun/): exercises about different parts of Arrow, and how you can apply them to a Compose Multiplatform project.
- [Example projects](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/design/projects/) from the Arrow documentation

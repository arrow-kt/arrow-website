# Arrow Open Space @ [Lambda World](https://lambda.world)

The first [Arrow & Fuctional Kotlin Open Space](https://www.lambda.world/workshops/Arrow%20%26%20Functional%20Kotlin%20Open%20Space/) is taking place as part of [Lambda World](https://lambda.world)! This post contains the preliminary schedule, and shall be updated after the Open Space takes place with additional material, slides, and videos.

## Unconference

We have a nice room, some sweets, and a nice projector. The perfect setup to share some knowledge about Arrow and Functional Kotlin! Our goal with the Unconference is to bring together people who can talk about something and people who want to learn about something.

_How does it work?_ Use the whiteboard!

- If you want to learn about a topic put a note in the _Hear_ column if none is already in _Talk_.
- If you want to talk about a topic put a note in the _Talk_ column if none is already in _Hear_.
- If there's a match, shout it out loud and let the talk begin!
  - Move the note to the _In progress_ column, and once it's done, to the _Done_ column.
  - It would be great if any material or code would be shared with the organizers, so we can later add it to this page.


## Build together

The goal of the Open Space is to learn. Many of us around are happy to help, so feel free to work in any project you want, and explore ways to use more functional features in your Kotlin. Once again, don't be shy to ask :)

If you are not sure about where to start, we have prepared a few tutorials and projects for you.

- [Pok√©-Fun with Kotlin and Arrow](https://serranofp.com/poke-fun/): exercises about different parts of Arrow, and how you can apply them to a Compose Multiplatform project.
- [Example projects](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/design/projects/) from the Arrow documentation

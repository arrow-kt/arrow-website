# Arrow 2.1.0

On top of hiding chocolate eggs, the Easter Bunny has helped us release a new version of Arrow, namely 2.1.0. Apart from [fixing several issues](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/releases/tag/2.1.0), this release is the first one with a [more integrated repository](https://arrow-kt.io/community/blog/2025/02/15/integration/).

**Integrated libraries.** As a result, the following libraries have bumped their versions from 0.x directly to 2.1.0.

- [`suspendapp`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.arrow-kt/suspendapp) and [`suspendapp-ktor`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.arrow-kt/suspendapp-ktor)
- [`arrow-core-jackson`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.arrow-kt/arrow-core-jackson)

These libraries are from now on part of the Arrow release train. These libraries are tested as part of every PR to our repository, ensuring the same level of quality as the rest of the Arrow libraries. The [API docs](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/index.html) also include them.

**New Ktor client module.** The new [`arrow-resilience-ktor-client`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-resilience-ktor-client/index.html) exposes Arrow's [resilience](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/resilience/) mechanisms as [Ktor client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-create-new-application.html) plug-ins. Just `install` [HttpRequestSchedule](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-resilience-ktor-client/arrow.resilience.ktor.client/-http-request-schedule.html) or [HttpCircuitBreaker](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-resilience-ktor-client/arrow.resilience.ktor.client/-http-circuit-breaker/index.html) to improve the behavior of your applications under unexpected circumstances.

**Soft deprecation of `arrow-atomic`.** The Kotlin Team has introduced new [common atomic types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew2120.html#common-atomic-types) as experimental in their 2.1.20 release. This new package covers the raison d'Ãªtre of `arrow-atomic`, so once the functionality in the standard library becomes stable, we intend to deprecate Arrow's (and hopefully, we'd have convinced the Kotlin Team to [include the `update` function](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-76389/Provide-update-functions-for-common-atomics) by then).

**`suspend`ed lazy evaluation.** Arrow contains a small module for [better control over evaluation](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/collections-functions/eval/). However, it used to lack support for `suspend`ed functions. [Until now](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/collections-functions/eval/).

**Broader Arrow ecosystem in documentation.** the Arrow organization develops a few libraries, and on top of that the community has created awesome patterns and functionality. We want to showcase those libraries even more in our documentation, since expanding that knowledge benefits every Arrow user. As a first step in that direction, our [typed errors documentation](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/typed-errors/outcome-progress/) now mentions [Quiver](https://block.github.io/quiver/) and [Pedestal](https://opensavvy.gitlab.io/groundwork/pedestal/api-docs/index.html).

On the topic of documentation, we would like to send special thanks to [Ivan Yakushev](https://github.com/theycome), which has submitted an incredible amount of grammar and spelling corrections to the Arrow website.

:::tip Improving together

We are happy to hear about missing topics in the documentation, either interesting libraries or simply parts of Arrow which need more coverage. Feel free to open an issue in [`arrow-website`](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow-website) (we also accept PRs!).

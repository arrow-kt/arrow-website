# Arrow 2.2.1

Arrow 2.2.1 is out!
The main focus of this release is better compatibility with
major releases in the Kotlin ecosystem, including
[Kotlin 2.3](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew23.html)
and [Jackson 3.0](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-3.0).

**Unused return value checker certified.**
The new [unused value checker](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew23.html#unused-return-value-checker)
in Kotlin 2.3 fits like a glove with the design principles behind Arrow.
For this release we have enabled the "full mode", meaning not only that
the Arrow codebase itself has been checked, but also that code using Arrow
gets additional support from the compiler.

**Alignment of exception handling.**
Handling exceptions in the right way is paramount to integrating with
structured concurrency from Kotlin coroutines. Alas, until this release
each Arrow module was doing their own thing, and it was unclear whether
this behavior was consistent.

Thanks to the efforts of [Youssef Shoaib](https://github.com/kyay10),
this is no longer the case. The shared bits have been moved to a separate
`arrow-exception-utils` library, but they re-exposed by both `arrow-core`
and `arrow-autoclose` in their previous form, so no migration is required.

**Support for Jackson 3.0.**
The [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) project is used all across
the JVM ecosystem to handle JSON. They have recently released a
[new major version](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-3.0),
with major players like [Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-jackson-3-support-in-spring)
updating their dependencies.
This release of Arrow moves the main `arrow-core-jackson` to Jackson 3.0 APIs.
The 2.x version will still be maintained, under the `arrow-core-jackson2` artifact.
